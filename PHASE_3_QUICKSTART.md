## Quick Backend Verification

```bash
# Check if samples are in database
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python3 << EOF
from app.database import SessionLocal
from app.models.audio_sample import AudioSample
db = SessionLocal()
samples = db.query(AudioSample).all()
print(f"Total samples: {len(samples)}")
for s in samples:
    print(f"  - {s.sample_name} ({s.duration_seconds}s)")
db.close()
EOF
```

## API Endpoints Working

Test manually with curl:

```bash
# Get auth token first
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=testuser&password=testpass" | jq -r .access_token)

# List samples
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/samples/

# Upload sample
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/samples/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "sample_name=Test Sample" \
  -F "upload_type=uploaded" \
  -F "file=@path/to/audio.wav"

# Delete sample
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/samples/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
